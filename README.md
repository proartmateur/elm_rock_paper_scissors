# elm_rock_paper_scissors

My first Web App developed with ELM language!

## Development Stack

- Styles: Sass(SCSS)
- Animations [animate.css] (https://animate.style/)
- UI: ELM v0.19.1
- Interaction: ELM v0.19.1

## Why ELM?

ELM looks pretty and elegant, i want to learn functional programming architectural patterns for building frontend and backend.
I think that some projects require to be so scalable and reliable, finding patterns for build this type of projects i found functional programming. I was start with Elixir language and Haskell but in frontend i was try with clojure and ELM, this is my first project 100% developed with a functional programming.

I love that elm have very much libraries and not make a hell of node_modules in my laptop with 250 GB of SSD.

For this project i am using webpack for build styles and have a workflow for work.

### Version 1
